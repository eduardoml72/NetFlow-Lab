# Firewall Logic Overview

## Default Behavior
- Inter-subnet traffic is explicitly allowed for lab purposes
- No restrictive policies are applied initially

---

## Monitoring Focus
Firewall rules are intentionally permissive to ensure traffic generation and visibility.

Security analysis is performed through NetFlow observation rather than traffic blocking.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Introduce restrictive policies
- Compare blocked vs allowed flows
- Correlate firewall logs with NetFlow data
